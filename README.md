The Momentum AI Tester is a tool to rapidly test the [AI](https://github.com/bp-momentum/ai) of the Momentum project and its API. It is a Tauri application that uses the SvelteKit framework.

## 🚀 Usage

### 📦 Installation

Go to the [releases](https://github.com/bp-momentum/ai-tester/releases) page and download the latest version for your operating system.

### 📡 Prerequisites

First, you need to start the AI. It needs to be accessible via the network. You can do this by running the AI in a Docker container and exposing the port. You can also run the AI locally. In both cases the Tester and the AI need to be on the same network and mutually accessible via the network - easiest way is to use the same machine. The `BACKEND_URL` environment variable needs to be set to the `localhost` and the port to a port that will later be used by the Tester. The port can be set in the settings of the Tester.

### ⚙️ Configuration

Once the AI is running, you can start the Tester. In the settings, you can set the IP and port of the AI. You also need to set the Backend Mock port to match the port that was set in the AI. The Backend Mock port is the port that the Tester will use to communicate with the AI. The Backend Mock port can be set to any port that is not used by any other application. The default port is `3000`.

### 🧪 Testing

After the settings are set, you can start testing. To test the AI, you need to set an expected execution in the `Expectation` tab. This can either be a video that will be processed internally or JSON object as generated by the [pose extractor](https://github.com/bp-momentum/pose_extractor).

Next under the `Test` tab, you can select multiple videos that will be processed by the AI. With the play button you can start each test. The Tester will send the video to the AI and wait for the result. The result will be displayed next to the video.

## 📝 Roadmap

- [x] Make Readme (fancy)
- [ ] Write CI/CD
- [ ] Handle Socket On Cancel
- [ ] Handle AI Errors (maybe)
